## Documentation

### MVD
* The **MVD** is powered by **Android**, thus all the development tools and APIs you already know can be used to
make your ideas spring to life.
* **Any app that run on your Android phone can run on the MVD.**  
* **Lacking a screen**, the MVD is a pure IoT device, just acting as a mediator between the physical world and
various data sources and services. 
* Is the focus of the Nordic IoT Hackathon. 
* As a requirement for the hackathon, **all teams have to use the MVD in their projects in order to be accepted to the hackathon**.
